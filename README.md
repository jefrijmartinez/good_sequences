## Instructions

In order for this to work you'll need to execute the following commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm test`

This will create the dependencies required such as `mocha` and `chai` for unit testing.

## Important

You should have `NodeJS` LTS version to be able to run it locally.

Information about the requirement can be located within the docs folder included in this repository.
